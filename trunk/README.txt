Commended
=========

Adds “Already known” line to item tooltips for Grand Commendations you
already have. Also colors the items red in merchant windows. Supports
xMerchant and GnomishVendorShrinker as well as the default UI.

I’m not sure whether it was intentional or an oversight on Blizzard’s
part that these items aren’t marked as “Already known” in the default
UI, but it seems like they should be, so I’m considering this a “bugfix”
addon, and hoping a future game patch renders it obsolete.
