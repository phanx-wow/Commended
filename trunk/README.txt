Description
-----------

Adds “Already known” line to item tooltips for Grand Commendations you
already have. Also colors the items red in merchant windows. Supports
xMerchant and GnomishVendorShrinker as well as the default UI.

I’m not sure whether it was intentional or an oversight on Blizzard’s
part that these items aren’t marked as “Already known” in the default
UI, but it seems like they should be, so I’m considering this a “bugfix”
addon, and hoping a future game patch renders it obsolete.

There are no options. It "just works".


Localization
------------

Compatible with all game locales. Does not require translations.


Feedback

If you are reporting a bug, please include detailed instructions I can
follow to reproduce the bug myself, whether the bug still happens when
all other addons are disabled, the exact text of the accompanying error
message if there is one, and a screenshot if the bug is visual.

If you need to contact me privately, you can send a private message to
Phanx on either download site, or email me at <addons@phanx.net>. Please
note that I DO NOT provide private addon support or programming help of
any kind; if you need help with an addon, or with writing or modifying
addon code, post a comment, ticket, or forum thread instead!
