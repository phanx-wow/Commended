Commended
=========

Adds “Already known” line to item tooltips for Grand Commendations you already have. Also colors the items red in merchant windows. Supports xMerchant and GnomishVendorShrinker as well as the default UI.

I’m not sure whether it was intentional or an oversight on Blizzard’s part that these items aren’t marked as “Already known” in the default UI, but it seems like they should be, so I’m considering this a “bugfix” addon, and hoping a future game patch renders it obsolete.
